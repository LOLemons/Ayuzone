            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine that has been practiced for over 5,000 years. Ayurveda places great emphasis on prevention and encourages the maintenance of health through close attention to balance in one's life, right thinking, diet, lifestyle, and the use of herbs. However, In recent years, Ayurveda has become industrialized and large companies have started to adulterate ayurvedic producst and falsely advertise them as authentic. This brings serious health concerns, especially for those who depend on ayurvedic medicines to treat ailments like high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiac issues, etc. It is important to understand the original principles and values behind Ayurveda to make informed decisions about the Ayurvedic products and remedies that we consume. In this website, we will explore the principles and values of ancient Ayurveda, modern vs. ancient Ayurveda, authentic Ayurvedic products, and homemade Ayurveda remedies.</p>
